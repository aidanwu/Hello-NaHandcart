# Hello-NaHandcart
      Git tutorial for "Hello World" refresher:
A bit about myself ---
My name is misconception as am I, move ever upward, lo, on high
a standard bearer, to decry
the pest, the pissed and the passer-by
All hail the revolution, that never evolved
Constrained 'neath solutions none wished to be solved
Oh, when I may code as fluently as I write
Words and Music in thoughtless flight
when I may code, half as well as I sketch
maybe then I shall no longer habitually kvetch
Git tutorial, refresher, retry
I am that I am,
and that I am, 
that am I...
